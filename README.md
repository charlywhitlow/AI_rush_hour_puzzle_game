AI coursework - an A* solver for the Rush Hour puzzle game

This was a piece of coursework for my year 3 Artificial Intelligence module.

The task was to implement an A* solver for the puzzle game Rush Hour, by extending the
partial java implementation that was provided.

I got 100% for this piece of work.

________

To run:

1. Compile all files:
javac */*.java

2. Run RushHour, specifying game encoding to use, e.g. random1.txt:
java -Xmx1g rushhour/RushHour game_encodings/random1.txt
